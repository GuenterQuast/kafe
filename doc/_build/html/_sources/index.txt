**kafe** -- Karlsruhe Fit Environment documentation
###################################################

**kafe** is a data fitting framework designed for use in
undergraduate physics lab courses. It provides a basic `Python` toolkit
for fitting and plotting using already available `Python` packages
such as `NumPy` and `matplotlib`, as well as `CERN` `ROOT`'s version of
the `Minuit` minimizer.

Summary
*******

The package provides a simple approach to fitting using variance-covariance
matrices, thus allowing for error correlations to be taken into account. This
implementation's error model assumes the measurement data (dependent variable)
is distributed according to a `Gaussian` distribution centered at its "true"
value. The spread of the distribution is given as a (:math:`1\sigma`)-error.

An "errors-in-variables" model is also implemented to take uncertainties in
the independent variable (`x` errors) into account. This is done by
specifying/constructing a separate variance-covariance matrix for the `x` axis
and "projecting" it onto the `y` error matrix. If the fit function
is approximated in each point by its tangent line, the `Gaussian` errors in
the `x` direction are not warped by this projection.

For examples on how to use **kafe**, see the ``examples`` folder. Consulting
the `API`_ can also be helpful.
