====================
Install dependencies
====================

kafe needs some packages to be installed in order to work (properly).

Most importantly, it needs a function minimizer. Currently, only two
are supported: CERN ROOT's TMinuit and iminuit

---------------------
Install ROOT::TMinuit
---------------------

If you have a working installation of ROOT with PyROOT support,
the TMinuit minimizer should work and no further installation
is needed. Consult the ROOT documentation for more info.

---------------
Install iminuit
---------------

iminuit is a Python wrapper for the Minuit minimizer which is
independent of ROOT. If compiling/installing ROOT is not possible,
this minimizer can be used instead.

To install the iminuit package for Python, using the Pip installer
(http://www.pip-installer.org/) is recommended:

    (sudo) pip install

If you don't have Pip installed, get it from the package manager:

    in Ubuntu/Mint/Debian, do:
	(sudo) apt-get install python-pip
    in Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, do:
	(sudo) yum install python-pip

or do:

    easy_install pip

You might need to install the python headers for iminuit to compile
properly:

    in Ubuntu/Mint/Debian, do:
        (sudo) apt-get install libpython2.7-dev
    in Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, do:
	(sudo) yum install python-devel

Read the README file for more information on other dependencies
(there should be adequate packages for your Linux distribution
to satisfy these).

---------
Using pip
---------

To install kafe using pip, simply run the helper script as root:

    ./install.sh

To remove kafe using pip, just run the helper script:

    ./uninstall.sh

----------------
Using setuptools
----------------

Installing using Python's setuptools works but does not provide a clean
uninstall. Use this method if installing with Pip is not possible:

    python setup.py install
