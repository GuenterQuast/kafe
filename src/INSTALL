=================
Install using Pip
=================

To install kafe using the Pip installer (http://www.pip-installer.org/), simply run the helper script as root:

    ./install.sh

If you don't have Pip installed, use:

    easy_install pip

To remove kafe using pip, just run the helper script:

   ./uninstall.sh

========================
Install using setuptools
========================

Installing using Python's setuptools works but does not provide a clean
uninstall. Use this method if installing with Pip is not possible:

    python setup.py install
