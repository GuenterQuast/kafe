kafe - Karlsruhe Fit Environment
********************************

To install kafe, check out the installation instructions in:

    kafe-<version>/src/INSTALL

You can browse the HTML documentation in:

    kafe-<version>/doc/_build/html/index.html

Requirements for version 0.3alpha1 of kafe are:

Python packages:
    * SciPy >= 0.12.0, which includes
        - NumPy >= 1.7.1 and 
        - matplotlib >= 1.2.0

Other dependencies:
    * ROOT >= 5.34 (http://root.cern.ch)
    * Qt4 >= 4.8.5 (could work with other versions)
    * PyQt >= 3.18.1 (could work with other versions)

Be sure to compile ROOT with PyROOT support. For Python to see the PyROOT
bindings, the following environment variables have to be set correctly:

    export ROOTSYS=<directory where ROOT is installed>
    export PYTHONDIR=<directory where Python is installed (non-standard)>
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH

For more info, refer to [http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/pyroot].

Qt is basically needed because it's the supported interactive frontend for
matplotlib. Other frontends are not supported and can cause weird behavior.
