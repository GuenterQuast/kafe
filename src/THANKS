Many many thanks to Prof. Günter Quast for initiating this project and
for his caring support during its development.
Special thanks to Dr. Fred-Markus Stober for co-supervising the project
and for his support in some key technical aspects.

Last but not least I would like to thank Joram Berger, René Caspart,
Fabio Colombo, Corinna Günth, Max Fischer, Raphael Friese, Dominik Haitz,
Benjamin Oldenburg, Marcus Schmitt, Georg Sieber and the rest of the
EKP team for their input and testing, as well as proofreading some early
and late write-ups of my thesis.
